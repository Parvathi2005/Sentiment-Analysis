# Sentiment Analysis Using NLP & Machine Learning
This project focuses on building a sentiment analysis model that classifies text data (e.g., user reviews, tweets, or comments) as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. It demonstrates a full pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation using popular Python libraries.
## ðŸ“Œ Features
**Data Preprocessing**:  
  Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF or CountVectorizer).
**Model Building**:  
  Implements machine learning models such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
**Evaluation Metrics**:  
  Includes accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
**Visualization**:  
  Graphical representation of sentiment distribution and model performance.
## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:
- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn  
- NLTK / spaCy  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
## ðŸ“ˆ Example Use Cases:
- Analyzing customer reviews from e-commerce platforms
- Monitoring brand sentiment on social media
- Understanding public opinion from survey data
- Filtering toxic or inappropriate content in forums
